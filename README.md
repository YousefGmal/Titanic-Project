# Titanic-Project
In this project, the most important question was what were the criteria for those who were rescued when the ship sank.
You remove unhelpful columns and missing values.
I converted the columns that contain categorical data to columns that contain numeric values to prepare the data and train the machine learning model (Logistic Regression & SVM) on this data
The purpose of the model is to determine whether this person will be saved or not
I used pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn libraries
